We're looking to bring on board 2-3 local <span style="display:none" class="georgia">Georgia</span> communities. 
-->The US EPA is creating [new input-output tools](../../community/tools/) for communities pursuing projects involving waste-to-energy, bioproducts and local environmental clean-up. Community participants include a coalition of representatives of diverse interests such as:

- local citizen groups
- local non-profits   
- local religious organizations
