# Innovative Web Applications for&nbsp;Local&nbsp;Communities 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with <span style="display:none" class="georgia">the Georgia Department of Economic Development Centers for Innovation and Georgia Tech to work with</span> local <span style="display:none" class="georgia">Georgia</span> communities to evaluate economic and environmental outcomes of new technologies and investment through web applications that use an economy-wide input-output model of industries, households and the environment. The new online tools will help communities identify and assess opportunities for economic growth and environmental sustainability.


Embedding input-output maps and charts is easy. Here's a sample to try:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://model.earth/localsite/js/localsite.js?display=everything&show=farmfresh&showheader=false&state=GA"></script>
```

## Opportunities for communities include

- Being one of the first communities in the US to take advantage of the EPA's new input-ouput model

- Creating an economic development tool for community decision-making that includes environmental aspects

- Looking in depth at your community's total footprint

- Evaluating prospective industries and the potential jobs they could directly 
 and indirectly create, and looking at their potential environmental performance
 
- Determining how technological improvements in your community's industries, utilities, or
consumption patterns could reduce its footprint

## Other resources include

- [Teachers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Students](./learn) may use the applications to learn about the connections
between industries, households, and the environment in communities.
